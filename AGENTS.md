## Personal GitHub Repository Guardrails (MANDATORY)

This is Ram's personal GitHub project. Before creating commits, use the
personal identity alias and verify it -- never inherit a corporate checkout
identity by accident:

```bash
git setlive
git config user.name   # must be Shreeram
git config user.email  # must be shreeram.v@live.com
git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
```

Before every push, inspect the commits being pushed:

```bash
git log origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD --format='%h %an <%ae> | %cn <%ce> %s'
```

If any author or committer is not Ram's personal identity, STOP. Do not push.
Correct the identity on only the personal-repository commits, coordinate first if
others may already have based work on them, and use `--force-with-lease` only
when rewriting the affected personal branch is explicitly safe. Never amend or
rewrite upstream contributors' commits.

Personal-repository content must not contain employer branding, internal
company references, internal agent/tool names, or internal artifact-host
instructions. Before committing documentation, templates, or generated assets,
search the changed files for those categories and remove them. Technical legacy
identifiers needed for compatibility are not marketing copy; explain them
without exposing internal company/tool references. Do not copy internal package
index URLs, hostnames, email addresses, usernames, or agent names into this
repository.

## Development Commands

**Prerequisites:**

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager

**Core Development:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run tauri dev
# If cmake error on macOS:
CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 bun run tauri dev

# Build for production
bun run tauri build

# Frontend only development
bun run dev        # Start Vite dev server
bun run build      # Build frontend (TypeScript + Vite)
bun run preview    # Preview built frontend
```

**Linting and Formatting (run before committing):**

```bash
bun run lint              # ESLint for frontend
bun run lint:fix          # ESLint with auto-fix
bun run format            # Prettier + cargo fmt
bun run format:check      # Check formatting without changes
bun run format:frontend   # Prettier only
bun run format:backend    # cargo fmt only
```

**Model Setup (Required for Development):**

Check `src-tauri/src/catalog/catalog.json` for the current model source and instructions. Do not guess a download hostname or replace a legacy model host with a made-up Vox domain.

For detailed platform-specific build setup, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture Overview

Vox is a cross-platform desktop speech-to-text application built with Tauri 2.x (Rust backend + React/TypeScript frontend).

### Backend Structure (src-tauri/src/)

- `lib.rs` - Main entry point, Tauri setup, manager initialization
- `managers/` - Core business logic:
  - `audio.rs` - Audio recording and device management
  - `model.rs` - Model downloading and management
  - `transcription.rs` - Speech-to-text processing pipeline
  - `history.rs` - Transcription history storage
- `audio_toolkit/` - Low-level audio processing:
  - `audio/` - Device enumeration, recording, resampling
  - `vad/` - Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD)
- `commands/` - Tauri command handlers for frontend communication
- `cli.rs` - CLI argument definitions (clap derive)
- `shortcut.rs` - Global keyboard shortcut handling
- `settings.rs` - Application settings management
- `overlay.rs` - Recording overlay window (platform-specific)
- `signal_handle.rs` - `send_transcription_input()` reusable function
- `utils.rs` - Platform detection helpers

### Frontend Structure (src/)

- `App.tsx` - Main component with onboarding flow
- `components/` - React UI components:
  - `settings/` - Settings UI
  - `model-selector/` - Model management interface
  - `onboarding/` - First-run experience
  - `overlay/` - Recording overlay UI
  - `update-checker/` - App update notifications
  - `shared/`, `ui/`, `icons/`, `footer/` - Shared components
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` - Settings state management hook
- `stores/settingsStore.ts` - Zustand store for settings
- `bindings.ts` - Auto-generated Tauri type bindings (via tauri-specta)
- `overlay/` - Recording overlay window entry point
- `lib/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript type definitions

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Manager Pattern:** Core functionality organized into managers (Audio, Model, Transcription) initialized at startup and managed via Tauri state.

**Command-Event Architecture:** Frontend → Backend via Tauri commands; Backend → Frontend via events.

**Pipeline Processing:** Audio → VAD → Whisper/Parakeet → Text output → Clipboard/Paste

**State Flow:** Zustand → Tauri Command → Rust State → Persistence (tauri-plugin-store)

### Technology Stack

**Core Libraries:**

- `transcribe-cpp` - Local Whisper-family inference (GGML/GGUF) with GPU acceleration
- `transcribe-rs` - ONNX speech recognition (Parakeet, Moonshine, SenseVoice, etc.)
- `cpal` - Cross-platform audio I/O
- `vad-rs` - Voice Activity Detection
- `rdev` - Global keyboard shortcuts
- `rubato` - Audio resampling
- `rodio` - Audio playback for feedback sounds

### Application Flow

1. **Initialization:** App starts minimized to tray, loads settings, initializes managers
2. **Model Setup:** First-run downloads preferred Whisper model (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large)
3. **Recording:** Global shortcut triggers audio recording with VAD filtering
4. **Processing:** Audio sent to Whisper model for transcription
5. **Output:** Text pasted to active application via system clipboard

### Settings System

Settings are stored using Tauri's store plugin with reactive updates:

- Keyboard shortcuts (configurable, supports push-to-talk)
- Audio devices (microphone/output selection)
- Model preferences (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large Whisper variants)
- Audio feedback and translation options

### Single Instance Architecture

The app enforces single instance behavior — launching when already running brings the settings window to front rather than creating a new process. Remote control flags (`--toggle-transcription`, etc.) work by launching a second instance that sends args to the running instance via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`, then exits.

## Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing strings must use i18next translations. ESLint enforces this (no hardcoded strings in JSX).

**Adding new text:**

1. Add key to `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`
2. Use in component: `const { t } = useTranslation(); t('key.path')`

**File structure:**

```
src/i18n/
├── index.ts           # i18n setup
├── languages.ts       # Language metadata
└── locales/
    ├── en/translation.json  # English (source)
    ├── de/, es/, fr/, ja/, ru/, zh/, ...
    └── ...
```

For translation contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md).

## Code Style

**Rust:**

- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing
- Handle errors explicitly (avoid unwrap in production)
- Use descriptive names, add doc comments for public APIs

**TypeScript/React:**

- Strict TypeScript, avoid `any` types
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Path aliases: `@/` → `./src/`

## CLI Parameters

Vox supports command-line parameters on all platforms for integration with scripts, window managers, and autostart configurations.

**Implementation:** `cli.rs` (definitions), `main.rs` (parsing), `lib.rs` (applying), `signal_handle.rs` (shared logic)

| Flag                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--toggle-transcription` | Toggle recording on/off on a running instance              |
| `--toggle-post-process`  | Toggle recording with post-processing on/off               |
| `--cancel`               | Cancel the current operation on a running instance         |
| `--start-hidden`         | Launch without showing the main window (tray icon visible) |
| `--no-tray`              | Launch without system tray (closing window quits the app)  |
| `--debug`                | Enable debug mode with verbose (Trace) logging             |

**Key design decisions:**

- CLI flags are runtime-only overrides — they do NOT modify persisted settings
- Remote control flags work via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`: second instance sends args, then exits
- `send_transcription_input()` in `signal_handle.rs` is shared between signal handlers and CLI

## Debug Mode

Access debug features: `Cmd+Shift+D` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux)

## Platform Notes

- **macOS**: Metal acceleration, accessibility permissions required for keyboard shortcuts
- **Windows**: Vulkan acceleration, code signing. Implicit Vulkan layers (overlays, capture hooks) are disabled for the Vox process via `VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE=~implicit~` set in `main.rs`; opt out with `HANDY_KEEP_VULKAN_IMPLICIT_LAYERS=1` or by setting `VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE` yourself
- **Linux**: OpenBLAS + Vulkan, limited Wayland support, overlay uses GTK layer shell (disable with `HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1`)
- **Nix/NixOS**: the Nix package sets `HANDY_DISABLE_UPDATER=1` to force-disable the self-updater at runtime without touching the persisted setting (self-update can't work against an immutable `/nix/store`)

The `HANDY_*` environment variables, `handy_keys` setting value, `Handy Portable Mode` marker, and `resources/handy*.png` asset filenames are historical compatibility identifiers retained for existing installations. They are not current product branding; do not rename them without a migration that continues to accept the previous values.

## Troubleshooting

## GitHub workflow for AI coding assistants

Before preparing a change for review, read the current repository PR template and follow it. AI assistants may help implement and validate changes, but must not open or submit PRs for this personal repository; prepare the branch and summary for Ram to submit. Never invent human-written text or claim that a PR was opened when it was not.

- **Opening an issue:** use the Vox issue template and personal repository links.
- **Proposing a feature:** document scope and tests in the relevant design/phase file before implementation.
- **Translations:** Follow `CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md`.
- **Full contributor workflow:** Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

**Commits:** Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`). Focus the message on why, not what.
